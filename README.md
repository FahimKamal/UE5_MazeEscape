## üéì Project Context & Motivation

This project, **"Blackout Facility,"** is being developed by **Fahim Kamal Ahmed** as the capstone assignment for **Course #4: Blueprint Scripting** of the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera.

The project is being built from the ground up using the standard Unreal Engine First-Person template to focus entirely on the application of Blueprint scripting principles. The primary goal is to translate the conceptual Game Design Document (GDD) into a fully playable, interactive, and logical puzzle-escape game. The focus is on implementing core gameplay mechanics, event-driven programming, and robust interaction systems‚Äîall built exclusively with Blueprints. This repository documents the development process and will showcase the completed game.

## üéØ Overview

**"Blackout Facility"** is a first-person puzzle-escape game built in **Unreal Engine 5**. The player awakens in a dark, two-story industrial complex without memory. They must explore, solve environmental puzzles, manage a simple inventory of key items, restore power to the facility, and navigate a logical sequence of challenges to find the exit.

The game is designed around a **first-person perspective** to enhance immersion and the feeling of isolation. The core experience is a loop of **Observe, Solve, and Progress**, challenging the player's logic and spatial awareness. This project aims to be a complete, self-contained game experience that demonstrates a strong command of Blueprint scripting for gameplay creation.

## üìú Game Design Document (GDD)

The entire design philosophy, detailed puzzle flow, gameplay mechanics, and narrative context for "Blackout Facility" are documented in the Game Design Document. This document serves as the blueprint for the development process.

## ‚ú® Key Goals & Features (To Be Achieved with Blueprints)

*   üî© **Robust Interaction System:** A flexible, interface-driven system (`BPI_Interact`) allows the player to seamlessly interact with any puzzle element in the world.
*   üîë **"Keychain" Inventory System:** A lightweight actor component (`AC_InventorySystem`) manages puzzle-critical items without needing a complex UI, enabling automatic key-and-lock mechanics.
*   üî¶ **Dynamic Player Abilities:** Core mechanics like a toggleable flashlight, crouching, and sprinting are implemented on the player character.
*   üí° **Environmental State Changes:** A major, level-wide lighting shift occurs when the player solves the generator puzzle, transforming the gameplay environment from dark and suspenseful to bright and clinical.
*   üß© **Diverse Puzzle Mechanics:** The game will feature a variety of puzzles built with Blueprints, directly reflecting the course content:
    *   **Physics-Based:** Pushing objects to reveal paths.
    *   **Triggers:** Hidden pressure plates that alter the environment.
    *   **Item Placement:** Using collected "Fusion Cores" to power a machine.
    *   **Timed Events:** A door that stays open for a limited time.
    *   **Sequence Puzzles:** Levers that must be pulled in a specific order.
*   üìÑ **GDD Adherence:** The gameplay systems and level flow from the GDD are to be fully translated into a playable, interactive 3D game.
*   üñ•Ô∏è **Minimalist UI/HUD:** Contextual interaction prompts and temporary item notifications (`UMG Widgets`) provide necessary feedback without cluttering the screen.
*   üì¶ **Complete Game Loop:** The project will be a complete, packaged game with a start menu, a win condition, and a clear beginning and end.
