## üéì Project Context & Motivation

This project, **"Blackout Facility,"** is being developed by **Fahim Kamal Ahmed** as the capstone assignment for **Course #4: Blueprint Scripting** of the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera.

The project is being built from the ground up using the standard Unreal Engine First-Person template to focus entirely on the application of Blueprint scripting principles. The primary goal is to translate the conceptual Game Design Document (GDD) into a fully playable, interactive, and logical puzzle-escape game. The focus is on implementing core gameplay mechanics, event-driven programming, and robust interaction systems‚Äîall built exclusively with Blueprints. This repository documents the development process and will showcase the completed game.

## üéØ Overview

**"Blackout Facility"** is a first-person puzzle-escape game built in **Unreal Engine 5**. The player awakens in a dark, two-story industrial complex without memory. They must explore, solve environmental puzzles, manage a simple inventory of key items, restore power to the facility, and navigate a logical sequence of challenges to find the exit.

The game is designed around a **first-person perspective** to enhance immersion and the feeling of isolation. The core experience is a loop of **Observe, Solve, and Progress**, challenging the player's logic and spatial awareness. This project aims to be a complete, self-contained game experience that demonstrates a strong command of Blueprint scripting for gameplay creation.

## üìú Game Design Document (GDD)

The entire design philosophy, detailed puzzle flow, gameplay mechanics, and narrative context for "Blackout Facility" are documented in the Game Design Document. This document serves as the blueprint for the development process.

## ‚ú® Key Goals & Features (Implemented & Planned)

*   üî© **Optimized Interaction System:** A flexible, interface-driven system allows the player to interact with puzzle elements. It uses a **custom "Interaction" trace channel** and a forward line trace from the player camera for efficiency.
*   üß∞ **Stacking Inventory System:** A lightweight actor component manages puzzle-critical items. The system is being built to stack items (e.g., collecting multiple keys increases a counter) and consume them as they are used.
*   üî¶ **Centralized Lighting Control:** A single `Light Controller` Blueprint manages the entire facility's illumination. This allows for dramatic, level-wide state changes, such as activating all lights when the main generator is repaired.
*   üí° **Dynamic Door System:** Doors are highly interactive with multiple states. They can be locked, unlocked via a key (which is consumed from inventory), or unlocked via a remote button. A visual indicator light (Red for locked, Green for unlocked) provides clear player feedback.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Multi-Stage Generator Puzzle:** The main puzzle requires the player to find 3 `Fusion Cells` and install them into a custom-modeled Power Generator. The generator itself has emissive materials that glow when active, providing visual confirmation of its status.
*   üèõÔ∏è **Inheritance-Based Collectibles:** A master `BP_CollectibleItem` class serves as a parent for all pickup items, with children like `BP_Key` and `BP_FusionCell` inheriting its base functionality.
*   ‚è≥ **Timed Event Puzzles:** A planned trap door puzzle will require the player to press a button and race to the door before it closes, testing their speed and awareness.

## üìä Project Status (As of July 5, 2025)

*   ‚úÖ **Core Systems Implemented:**
    *   **Input:** WASD Movement, F for Flashlight, E for Interaction are all functional.
    *   **Interaction:** Line trace system using a custom "Interaction" trace channel is complete.
    *   **Lighting:** Central `Light Controller` is built. It correctly starts the level dark (with some flickering lights) and can turn on all lights on command.
    *   **Collectible Base:** `BP_CollectibleItem` parent class and its children (`BP_Key`, `BP_FusionCell`) are created.

*   ‚úÖ **Puzzle Elements & Mechanics Implemented:**
    *   **Door System:** Fully functional `BP_Door` with lock/unlock states, key requirement logic, remote button activation, and a Red/Green indicator light.
    *   **Generator System:** The custom-modeled Power Generator is in the level. The logic to collect 3 Fusion Cells and activate it to trigger the `Light Controller` is complete.

*   ‚è≥ **Currently In Progress:**
    *   **Inventory System:** Developing the logic for items to "stack" (increasing/decreasing a number count) within the player's inventory component.
    *   **Inventory UI:** Planning a simple UMG widget to display the name and quantity of collected items.

*   üî≤ **Next Steps / To-Do:**
    *   **Elevator System:** Build the elevator actor, its movement logic, and link its activation to the generator being powered on.
    *   **Timed Door Puzzle:** Implement the timed "trap door" that requires the player to sprint to it before it closes.
    *   **Floor 2:** Design, greybox, and implement the puzzles for the second floor.
    *   **UI & Menus:** Create the Main Menu and Pause Menu.
    *   **Audio Pass:** Add placeholder sound effects for key interactions.

## üå± Learning & Development Focus

This project is designed to build and demonstrate proficiency in:

*   **Blueprint Scripting Fundamentals:** Mastering the creation and use of variables, functions, macros, and flow control.
*   **Event-Driven & Object-Oriented Principles:** Creating self-contained, reusable Blueprints that communicate effectively, highlighted by the use of **Blueprint Inheritance** for items.
*   **Robust Interaction Design:** Building a scalable and **optimized** interaction system using Blueprint Interfaces and custom trace channels.
*   **Gameplay Systems Architecture:** Designing and implementing core systems like an inventory and stateful puzzles.
*   **State Management:** Effectively managing the state of the entire game world through a centralized controller (like the `Light Controller`).
*   **Full Project Lifecycle:** Taking a game from a design document through development, testing, and final packaging.

## üîÆ Future Plans (Post-Course Development for Portfolio Enhancement)

Once the course requirements are met, this project could be enhanced for a portfolio:

*   üé® **Art Pass:** Replace the greybox assets with a cohesive set of industrial or sci-fi environment assets to give the facility a distinct visual identity.
*   üìñ **Narrative Deepening:** Add environmental storytelling elements like notes, audio logs, or computer terminals that reveal the backstory of the facility.
*   üß© **Puzzle Complexity:** Introduce more complex logic puzzles, perhaps involving combining items or multi-stage sequences.
*   üéß **Audio Polish:** Implement a full sound-scape with ambient background loops, distinct footstep sounds, and higher-quality SFX.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Refine Systems:** Add features like a more detailed options menu or controller support.
